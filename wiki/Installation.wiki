#summary Installation instructions for the plugin.

= Introduction =

<p>Before installing the plugin in Joomla you'll want to gather some critical information from your <a href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?pr=1&id=172687" target="_blank">1ShoppingCart</a> or Private label reseller administration area. You'll also need a Professional version of the 1ShoppingCart product since this plugin relies on API calls that are not available in the AutoResponder, Starter or Basic versions.
